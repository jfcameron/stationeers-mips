  <Instructions># === FEATURES =====================================
# Automatically runs an arc furnace and captures
# gas produced from smelting
#
# Note: I find arc furnace automation very buggy
# This program is meant to be as simple as possible,
# but I find that every few real life days I have to
# deconstruct and reconstruct the furnace to get it
# out of a bad state.
# The states Ive seen: furnace is smelting the same
# ore indefinitely.
# furnace turns itself off when it tries to activate
# and will not turn back on
# The fix is simply to reconstruct it

# === BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ===========================
# create a 1x1x1 chamber.
# inside place:
# arc furnace
# gas sensor
# active vent, connected to a gas system
# run chutes to the input and output of the furnace
# the more chutes used for input, the more work can
# be queued

# === DEVICES ======================================
alias dArcFurnace d0
alias dGasSensor d1
alias dActiveVent d2

# === GLOBALS ======================================
alias rActiveVentOn r15

# === PROGRAM ======================================
s dArcFurnace On 1

MainLoop:
# Pull gas from smelting into the gas system
move rActiveVentOn 0
l r0 dGasSensor Pressure
bgtal r0 0 bDoDepressurize
s dActiveVent Mode 1
s dActiveVent On rActiveVentOn

# Work the furnace
s dArcFurnace Activate 1
sleep 10

j MainLoop

# === BRANCHING ====================================
bDoDepressurize:
move rActiveVentOn 1
